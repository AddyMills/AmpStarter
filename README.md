# AmpStarter
 Script to easily start an Amplitude 2016 custom
 
 Dependencies required: mido
 
 Due to the nature of Amplitude's many possible track combinations and difficult naming conventions, I created this script to give you a starter. It will create 6 MIDI tracks with the proper track names, as well as the extra tracks present in other Amplitude songs (T7 FREESTYLE, BG_CLICK, and WORLD).
 
## Usage:
 -Run the script (or executable) from within your terminal with 6 arguments.
Acceptable arguments:
  * bass
  * drums
  * guitar (or gtr)
  * synth
  * vocals (or vox)

This will create a .mid file in the folder you executed the script from you can use as your starter.
